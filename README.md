# ES6 Interfaces
Implementation of Interfaces on ES6 JS

This code can be build on NodeJS v6.17.1 and up but you've to use v14.0.0 or higher to run the node tests.

The idea of this code is to use for implement S.O.L.I.D in Javascript, specifically the [Interface segregation principle][solid-isp] and [Dependency inversion principle][solid-dip]. Some examples of implementation are provided [here][examples].
